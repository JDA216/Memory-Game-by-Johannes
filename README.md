# Memory-Game-by-Johannes
A memory game is a game designed to test a player's memory.
The game consists of a set of cards placed face down on a table. 
Each card has a matching pair, and the goal of the game is to find all the pairs by flipping over the cards two at a time.
The player must remember where each card is located and its corresponding match. 
In this version every correct pair adds two points to the score. Every not matching pair subtracts one point of the score.
The goal of this version is to reach the highest score.
The memory game is a classic activity that is enjoyed by people of all ages.
